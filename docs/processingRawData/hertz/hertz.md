# Understanding Hertz (Hz)

One hertz simply means "one cycle per second" (typically that which is being counted is a complete cycle); 100 Hz means "one hundred cycles per second", and so on. The unit may be applied to any periodic eventâ€”for example, a clock might be said to tick at 1 Hz, or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2 Hz.
