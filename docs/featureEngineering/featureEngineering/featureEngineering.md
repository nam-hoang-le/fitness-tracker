# Feature engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used for machine learning. This involves selecting the most useful features from the raw data and using them to build or create new features that represent the information in the dataset in a more effective way. These new, engineered features can make it easier for machine learning models to learn from the data and make more accurate predictions when done right.


Examples: 

- Alter existing data

- Use domain knowledge

- Numerical features

- Temporal features

- Frequency features

- Principle component analysis
